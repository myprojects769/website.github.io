                What is digital marketing, and why does it matter? That’s precisely what I plan to discuss today.

Digital marketing means using digital channels, like search engines, social media, email, mobile apps, and websites, to promote a product or service. This umbrella term also includes marketing using digital devices such as TV or radio.

Examples of online digital marketing include:

Search engine optimization (SEO): optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engines like Google.
Pay-per-click advertising (PPC): paying for advertisements to appear on search engine results pages or social media platforms.
Social media marketing: creating and sharing content on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to increase brand awareness and engagement.
Content marketing: creating and sharing valuable content, such as blog posts, e-books, or videos, thus attracting and retaining a specific audience.
Leveraging traditional offline media for advertising: using radio and TV marketing, billboard advertising, print, and in-person events.
Analysts predict the global digital advertising and marketing sector will reach $786.2 billion by 2026, with clicks and display ads among the most dominant forms.

Then there’s offline digital marketing like:

Out-of-Home Advertising: This involves using billboards, transit ads, or other types of visual media to promote your brand or product. This can be a great way to reach a broad audience and create a strong visual impression.
TV Marketing: where you promote your products in the form as adverts, infomercials, or even demonstrations.
Radio marketing: Trailers and commercials promoting your product to listeners.
In other reports by PR Newswire, digital marketing is worth an estimated $460 billion in the US.
You can do digital marketing online and offline,
